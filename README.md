# API for USDA Child Nutrition Database
The USDA Child Nutrition Database can be a difficult thing to navigate especially if you're not using Access. This provides a self hosted method of getting information from the database through a simple API.

Currently using latest CN20 database. Repo will be updated to CN21 once made available by the USDA.

*Documentation coming soon*
